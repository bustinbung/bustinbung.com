## Behind the Scenes

This was a project that Anela and I created for our Production Basics class in the fall of 2024. The script was adapted from an idea for a novel that Anela had, so I felt confident in the story. I think we fell short by trying to include too muchâ€”we tried to tell a novel's worth of content into just 6 pages, which I think was too much to fit in. We'd like to expand this into a longer piece so we have more room to tell the stories Anela's dreamt up.
