## Behind the Scenes

This was a mostly improvised film, with the only scripted dialogue being between the (spoiler) sock puppets at the end. Our lead actor, Priscilla, did a phenomenal job working with the story beats Anela and Liliana gave her, and the whole film was shot in about 8 hours one afternoon.
