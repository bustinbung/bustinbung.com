The Art and Music Project (The AMP) is a small collective of creatives dedicating to amplifying artists on the rise. Founded by Fletcher Johnson, Luka Briglevich, and Gabrielle Held, the AMP posted the first episode on September 15th, 2023, featuring John Montarella. The series regularly features visual artists and musicians based in Athens or Atlanta, Georgia.

## My Role

I came on in 2024, and have been involved in filming and editing AMP episodes. I've also been involved in helping lead production as the AMP adjusts its leadership structure and content schedule.
