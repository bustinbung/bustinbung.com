Webpage that generates visuals for counting polyrhythms, written in HTML, CSS, and JS. Hopefully undergoing a rewrite into a SPA framework (hi [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)) soon.

Hosted [here](https://polyrhythm.bustinbung.com) with source code [here](https://github.com/bustinbung/polyrhythm-generator).
