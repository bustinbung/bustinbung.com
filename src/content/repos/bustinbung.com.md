My personal webpage and blog, written in [Astro](https://astro.build), using a modified version of the [consolo](https://github.com/Forthoney/consolo) theme for Jekyll.

## History

- v1: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Used the [XP.css](https://botoxparty.github.io/XP.css/) theme.
- v2: Used Jekyll as a static site generator. Used the [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) theme.
- v3: Continued to use Jekyll, this time with a modified version of the [consolo](https://github.com/Forthoney/consolo) theme.
- v4: Made the switch to SvelteKit to learn Svelte via trial by fire. Using stylesheets from the previous site.
- v5: Rewritten in Astro to experiment with a dedicated static framework.
